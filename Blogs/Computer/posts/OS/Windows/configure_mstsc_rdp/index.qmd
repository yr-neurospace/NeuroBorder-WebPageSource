## Save user name and password in RDP file

Once you have created a RDP file from `mstsc` or anywhere else, you can save your user name and password in your RDP file to achieve one-step login by adding or modifying the following two lines:

```
username:s:<type your user name here>
password 51:b:<type your encrypted password here>
```

The encrypted password can be generated from your literal password in PowerShell by typing the command:

```
("<type your literal password here>" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force) | ConvertFrom-SecureString
```
