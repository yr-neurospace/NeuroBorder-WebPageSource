It can be visited via `http://172.16.50.209:61111`, which is an **internal** IP and not a permanent IP. This means that it cannot be visited outside and may be changed in the future. If it's invalid sometime in the future, please let me know. I will update it as I can.\n\n## Notes for Graph Apps\n\n1. ggplot2 aesthetic specifications: you can find supported formats for ggplot2 aesthetics of color, line type, point shape, etc. [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html).\n\n## Download and run NeuroBorder Shiny App in your laptop\n\n### Install R, Rtools, RStudio\n\nDownload and install suitable versions of R and/or Rtools (recommended for Windows users) for your computer from [the offical R website](https://www.r-project.org) or more directly from some mirrors of it, like [TUNA Team of Tsinghua University](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/CRAN).\n\nIt's highly recommended to download and install suitable version of RStudio for your computer from [the offical RStudio website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop) although this is unnecessary for running NeuroBorder Shiny App. But it can provide a great deal of convenience for you to use R.\n\n### Install R packages\n\nOpen your R/RStudio, and paste the following code into your console, and enter to run it:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"FactoMineR\")\ninstall.packages(\"aplot\")\ninstall.packages(\"bslib\")\ninstall.packages(\"digest\")\ninstall.packages(\"enrichplot\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggforce\")\ninstall.packages(\"gginnards\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggnewscale\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggprism\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggrepel\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggtext\")\ninstall.packages(\"glue\")\ninstall.packages(\"magrittr\")\ninstall.packages(\"scales\")\ninstall.packages(\"shiny\")\ninstall.packages(\"stringr\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"uuid\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Download and run NeuroBorder Shiny App\n\nNow, you can download the NeuroBorder Shiny App from [here](https://github.com/yr-neurospace/NeuroBorder-ShinyWebApp). And then just click **Code** $\\to$ **Download ZIP** step by step.\n\nOnce you have downloaded and unzipped it, you will find a file named `app.R`, which is the top entry for this app. Of course, you don't need to care about what it is.\n\nNext, open your R/RStudio, and paste the following code into your console, and enter to run it:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshiny::runApp(appDir = \"C:/Users/yangrui/Downloads/NeuroBorder-ShinyWebApp-main\", launch.browser = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n**NOTE:** you should replace the path `C:/Users/yangrui/Downloads/NeuroBorder-ShinyWebApp-main` with yours. This is a path to the directory containing `app.R`.\n\nIn theory, the system's default web browser will be launched automatically after the app is started. If it is not the case, you can find the listening address from its output like `Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3593`, and paste `http://127.0.0.1:3593` to your browser yourself. So far, you can use it just like a web page.\n",
